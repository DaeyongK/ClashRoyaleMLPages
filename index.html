        <h2>Introduction / Background</h2>
        <p>Clash Royale is a real-time strategy mobile game developed by Supercell, where players create decks of eight cards 
            from over a hundred choices. It is imperative for Clash Royale players to understand what the most commonly used 
            decks in the game are so that they can be prepared.</p>

        <b>Literature Review</b>
        <p>One paper discusses how to best select a small subset of data that can efficiently train a deck win rate prediction model 
        – useful to us given the size of our dataset [1]. Another paper tries finding players with similar profiles, then grouping
        together their most played decks [2]. Yet another approach learns the meaning of card descriptions using NLP, in order to 
        predict what cards work well together or could replace each other [3]. Interestingly, there is potential that a model for
        Clash Royale can expand to other deck-building games; frameworks like SENSEI aim to do so [4].</p>
        <b>Dataset Description</b>
        <p>Our dataset consists of data on almost 40 million randomly selected battles during Clash Royale’s 18th season. For each battle, 
        there is data on the name, level, and rarity of each card in either player’s decks, as well as which deck won and which lost. 
        There is also data on which cards are in the game, as well as which cards are considered win conditions, or “wincons”.</p>

        <h2>Problem Definition</h2>
        <ul>
            <p>1. Given two player decks, can we decide who wins and how hard they win by? (Supervised Learning)</p>
            <p>2. What are the different metas and deck archetypes in the game? (Unsupervised Learning)</p>
        </ul>

        <h2>Methods</h2>
        <h4>Preprocessing Methods</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Sampling Data: </b>We have a very large dataset (>5 GB), so it will be impractical to train a model with this much data. By randomly sampling data, we can obtain a much smaller subset of our dataset that is representative of all of the match data.</li>
            <li><b>One-Hot Encoding: </b>We decided to One-Hot Encode our Clash Royale Deck decks. This was because Clash Royale decks are composed of 8 unique cards, which are categorical by nature. So it wouldn't have made sense to use quantitative data for decks.</li>
            <li><b>Feature Inversion: </b>The given data was formatted in the form of "Winner Deck" and "Loser Deck". Hence, there was no separate "winner" label that we could train our future supervised models for. Hence, after One-Hot encoding the sampled data, we inverted the decks and added in a winner label.</li>
            <li><b>Feature Engineering: </b>Because we One-Hot Encoded our data, we had many features (211). Because high dimension data would be hard to use for our machine learning algorithms, we used UMAP (Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection) to reduce our features significantly. UMAP was recommended over other feature reduction algorithms such as PCA for discrete, One-Hot encoded data like ours.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Machine Learning Methods</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><b>DBScan: </b>DBSCAN is a versatile unsupervised algorithm that fits our use case of detecting deck metas because we do not have specific ground truth labels for deck archetypes. With a practically infinite number of deck combinations, we needed DBSCAN to be able to detect deck outliers as well as use density based clustering to adaptively find similar decks and cluster them together. This specific use case is perfect for detecting arbitrary clusters as well as finding clusters that are not well seperated.</li>
        </ul>

            <img src="AvgSilhouette.png" alt="avg">
        <b>Quantitiative Metrics</b>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Silhouette Coefficient: </b>The Silhouette Coefficient measures how well a data point fits into its own cluster when compared to other clusters.
            The average Silhoutte Score for our data was 0.331 as seen by Image 10. Common deck archetypes such as Hog 2.6 [Image 2] and Log Bait [Image 7] had Silhouette Scores of 0.954
            and 0.987 respectively. The high Silhouette Score is representative of our DBScan's strong performance. An interesting observation is that the cluster in [Image 3] had a lower
            Silhouette Score, being 0.341. This however makes sense as this cluster is formed by the eight most popular/strong cards at the time, meaning that though they had high usage 
            rates across all decks, the combination of cards themselves didn't necessarily form a cohesive deck.</li>
        </ul>
        <b>Deeper Analysis of DBScan: </b>
            <p>The way we determined our clusters is through thresholding. Naively, we can take the 8 most popular cards, but then we risk including cards that don't receive a lot of support. 
            For instance, if 7 cards appear 100 times within a group, but the 8th most popular card appears 20 times, we should not include that card in our deck, and instead let the remaining 
            cards be 'wildcards' meaning that those remaining cards vary a lot from deck to deck, but they aren't required to define that deck type. We can accomplish this by applying a frequency
            threshold and once the next most popular card falls below 75% of the previous frequency, we don't include any more cards in our current deck.</p>
            <br>
            <p>DB Scan performed well on our preprocessed dataset, as we were able to find and confirm every cluster's corresponding deck archetype with high Silhouette Scores.</p>
        <b>Project Goals and Next Steps</b>
        <ul>
            <li>For Next Steps, we plan to continue refining our implementation and perhaps looking into fine tuning the hyper parameters of our algorithm to find more specific deck clusters. 
            Our largest cluster, cluster 0, is currently just the 8 most commonly played cards from 2021, meaning there is too much parity in the way our algorithm selects clusters. If we are 
            able to detect more clusters, with high confidence, then we can find more popular or niche deck archetypes. We also intend on looking into Supervised methods.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>In this project, we are aiming to create models that will benefit the general Clash Royale player base. Detecting deck metas 
            is paramount to creating a sustainable competitive experience. Additionally, we will consider ethical implications by hiding 
            sensitive data and ensuring data protection.</li>
        </ul>
        <b>Expected Outcomes</b>
        <ul>
            <li>Hoping that model clusters cards together that were real meta archetypes in season 18</li>
            <li>Predicting accurate match outcomes, in accordance with how different decks counter each other.</li>
        </ul>
