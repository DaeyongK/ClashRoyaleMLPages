        <h2>Introduction / Background</h2>
        <p>Clash Royale is a real-time strategy mobile game developed by Supercell, where players create decks of eight cards 
            from over a hundred choices. It is imperative for Clash Royale players to understand what the most commonly used 
            decks in the game are so that they can be prepared.</p>

        <b>Literature Review</b>
        <p>One paper discusses how to best select a small subset of data that can efficiently train a deck win rate prediction model 
        – useful to us given the size of our dataset [1]. Another paper tries finding players with similar profiles, then grouping
        together their most played decks [2]. Yet another approach learns the meaning of card descriptions using NLP, in order to 
        predict what cards work well together or could replace each other [3]. Interestingly, there is potential that a model for
        Clash Royale can expand to other deck-building games; frameworks like SENSEI aim to do so [4].</p>
        <b>Dataset Description</b>
        <p>Our dataset consists of data on almost 40 million randomly selected battles during Clash Royale’s 18th season. For each battle, 
        there is data on the name, level, and rarity of each card in either player’s decks, as well as which deck won and which lost. 
        There is also data on which cards are in the game, as well as which cards are considered win conditions, or “wincons”.</p>

        <h2>Problem Definition</h2>
        <ul>
            <p>1. Given two player decks, can we decide who wins and how hard they win by? (Supervised Learning)</p>
            <p>2. What are the different metas and deck archetypes in the game? (Unsupervised Learning)</p>
        </ul>

    <section id="methods">
        <h2>Methods</h2>
        <h4>Preprocessing Methods</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Imbalanced Data: </b>There is a large disparity in match data between the lower and higher arenas, so, we will only sample from matches at 4000+ trophies, the main competitive trophy range from which most of our data lies.</li>
            <li><b>Sampling Data: </b>We have a very large dataset (>5 GB), so it will be impractical to train a model with this much data. By randomly sampling data, we can obtain a much smaller subset of our dataset that is representative of all of the match data.</li>
            <li><b>Feature Engineering: </b>Our dataset contains statistics of the cards used in each battle and the battle outcomes, however, it will be useful to have derived features that capture the pairings between certain cards.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Machine Learning Methods</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><b>KMeans: </b>The nature of our meta identification problem requires an unsupervised method since our dataset does not contain truth information on common card combinations. Thus, we can use KMeans to create clusters of similarly constructed decks.</li>
            <li><b>GMM: </b>In the event that KMeans does not perform well, we may need to fit our model to clusters with a non-circular shape.</li>
            <li><b>Random Forest: </b>Our battle prediction problem calls for supervised learning using Random Forests, as our dataset contains ground truth labels with the match outcomes between decks.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

        <h2>Results and Discussion</h2>
        <b>Metrics</b>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Silhouette Coefficient: </b>Measures how well a data point fits into its own cluster when compared to other clusters.</li>
            <li><b>Davies-Bouldwin Index: </b>Measures how tightly compact a cluster is and how separated a cluster is from other clusters.</li>
            <li><b>Accuracy, Precision, Recall: </b>General metrics that test how our model can detect real match outcomes.</li>
        </ul>
        <b>Project Goals</b>
        <p>In this project, we are aiming to create models that will benefit the general Clash Royale player base. Detecting deck metas 
        is paramount to creating a sustainable competitive experience. Additionally, we will consider ethical implications by hiding 
        sensitive data and ensuring data protection. 
        </p>
        <b>Expected Outcomes</b>
        <ul>
            <li>Hoping that model clusters cards together that were real meta archetypes in season 18</li>
            <li>Predicting accurate match outcomes, in accordance with how different decks counter each other.</li>
        </ul>
